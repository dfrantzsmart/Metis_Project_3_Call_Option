## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Continue to work towards creating functions in py files. E.g. your "label_cm" function

## Good Documentation:

- Reminder to include a project readme that includes project overview, methods, and finding.
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis, do this for each section of modeling. Will help you and the reader. 
  E.g. talk about why you chose Xgboost and undersampling techniques.
- Use more Inline code comments 
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining decisions made.

## Proper Data Science:

- Good job using xgboost, next step is to tune the hyperparameters. An example of how to do this using grid search

- In the case of class imbalance, reminder to use x_under and y_under for the xgboost. it appears you used it for RF and Xgboost Regressor
- Good visualizations and app. 

## Comments:

- Good job on project 3
- Enjoyed the a concept of the idea. Taking it from the traditional look at stocks and more into options
- Nice visualizations and analysis (provide more insight language in your github)
- Be sure to include a "results" section in your README in the future -- just a quick high-level overview of your key takeaways!
